Lab 4 Choropleth Mapping and Census Data

The scenario

You are working for the State of California in the GIS department, supporting multiple agencies.

You have been contacted by the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) budget office to produce a statewide map

showing public transportation usage by county. Of interest to the budget office is how to allocate the $978,360,000 in

available funds in the 2009-2010 Public Transportation account between California’s 58 counties. They will be making

funding allocation decisions and want to compare public transportation usage across the state in order to help them

decide how to allocate the funds.

You will be making several maps in this assignment, all in PDF format. The first exhibit will show your clients various

options they have for their map, depending on how the data are classified. You will be helping to guide them toward

the best and most useful map based on your knowledge of advanced cartography and choropleth mapping techniques.

You have obtained recent CA public transportation data, by county, from the US Census FactFinder website.

Deliverables

For this assignment you will turn in three ArcMap document files (.mxd) and three .pdf files, by email, to your instruc-
tor (see Section 8 for specifics).
