Lab 3 East Palo Alto Land Use

The scenario

The city of East Palo Alto plans to build a community child care center using $5 million donated by an unnamed

Silicon Valley philanthropist. The center will provide free child care for residents of East Palo Alto, in order to allow

more mothers and single parents to participate in the labor market. You are the city planner assigned to study where

the facility should be located.

The criteria

Based on meetings you have attended, you have gathered that the center should be located inside a residential zone

and cannot be within 500 feet of a leaking underground storage tank identified by the Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA). Ideally, it should be in a convenient location close to where the families with children (your “custom-
ers”) live.

The problem

You have some base GIS data layers in your system but none that depict the particular features needed for this child

care center analysis. But you have done some research on the internet and compiled some images and text files and

data tables that are relevant.

This assignment introduces the idea of turning non-GIS data sources into mappable data.

Our created data will be 1) a landuse polygon layer, 2) a leaking underground storage tank point location layer, and 3)

a customer point location layer. We will build the GIS data in the UTM Zone 10 coordinate system. Finally, you will

create a simple map layout showing the new data layers you created. Turn in the shapefiles you create for this assign-
ment as well as a final map output and your map document.
