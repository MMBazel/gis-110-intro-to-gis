# Lab 1 Vasco Caves

Background

You are working for the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) to study the desirability of acquir-
ing the Vasco Caves near Byron, as a new park unit. The East Bay counties contain numerous impor-
tant natural California habitats.

Of interest to the land managers in this hypothetical scenario is the distribution of special status wild-
life species around the Vasco Caves area. You are to make an exhibit map for land managers showing

the distribution of one wildlife species in the area, to help in the decision-making process.

The exhibit will show both a detailed view of the immediate area and an overview that shows the area

in context of the rest of the East Bay.

Specifically, the overview will show the county lines, major towns, other EBRPD owned lands, and

major highways. The detailed view will show the distribution of your assigned wildlife species, the

extent of the Vasco Caves Land Bank, the area’s terrain, streams, and roads. The wildlife species are

assigned as follows:

Your last name begins with Common name (“CNAME”) of your assigned species

A-G California tiger salamander

H-P California red-legged frog

Q-Z burrowing owl
